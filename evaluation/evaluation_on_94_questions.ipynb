They lead to the degrees Bachelor of Science (BSc) and Master of Science (MSc). The carefully worded English version is informative, but the officially binding version is the German text held by L1 – Legal Affairs and Academic Quality Management.\",\n",
    "    \"The Grundlagen- und Orientierungsprüfung (GOP) is an early examination intended to show that students can meet the requirements of an academic course of study in their chosen subjects and that they have acquired the methodological skills required to continue their studies successfully. The GOP is considered passed when at least 30 ECTS credits have been earned from the modules designated as part of the GOP in the relevant degree programme and examination regulations and all requirements stipulated there have been fulfilled. According to Section 3, students must complete the GOP by the end of the second semester, with a possible extension of one semester under the general deadline rules.\",\n",
    "    \"The Bachelor’s degree programme is divided into a four-semester foundation phase worth 120 ECTS credits and a subsequent specialisation phase lasting two semesters with examinations worth 60 ECTS credits. The standard duration of the Bachelor’s programme, including all examinations and the Bachelor’s thesis, is six semesters and requires a total of 180 ECTS credits. The regular teaching and examination language is German, though individual modules may be taught and assessed in English as specified in the degree programme regulations and module handbook. The Bachelor’s programme starts in the winter semester.\",\n",
    "    \"The Master’s degree programme builds on the contents of the Bachelor’s programme and is more research-oriented. It usually comprises three study semesters plus one semester reserved for working on the Master’s thesis, for a total standard duration of four semesters. To complete the programme successfully, students must earn 120 ECTS credits, including all required module examinations and the Master’s thesis module. The teaching and examination language is generally German, but individual modules may be offered and examined in English, and the degree programme and examination regulations may allow other languages. The Master’s programme may normally be started in either the winter semester or the summer semester, unless otherwise stipulated for a specific programme.\",\n",
    "    \"The degree programmes and examinations are based on the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). In these regulations, 30 ECTS credits are allocated per semester as the standard workload. One ECTS credit corresponds to 30 hours of work. ECTS credits are used to categorise, calculate and confirm the amount of work a student has invested and thus serve as a quantitative indicator of the student’s workload.\",\n",
    "    \"A module is defined as a chronologically connected and self-contained teaching and learning unit whose content can be tested in an examination. Each module is completed with a module examination, which as a rule consists of one examination achievement or one course achievement; in justified cases it may consist of several partial examinations or a combination of examination and course achievements. Examinations may be written, oral, electronic or subject-specific (such as tutorial, practical or seminar achievements). Tutorial achievements generally involve weekly exercises documented via logs or electronic records; practical achievements involve practical tasks with reports and tests; seminar achievements usually consist of a presentation and a written handout. ECTS credits are only awarded for successfully completed modules that are verified by an individual, identifiable performance in a module examination. In addition, voluntary intermediate examinations (such as short tests, tutorial work or homework) may be offered; if a student opts to use them, these achievements can improve the grade of a passed module examination or partial examination by up to 0.7 but can never make the grade worse.\",\n",
    "    \"Compulsory attendance may be required for teaching units that are marked accordingly in the module description if the qualification goals can only be achieved through regular attendance. This is especially the case when each student’s presence is necessary for all participants to acquire subject-specific skills, when an individual’s skill acquisition depends on the attendance of others, when skills can only be obtained at a specific place, or when safety reasons require attendance. Regular attendance is defined as missing no more than 15% of instruction time in a teaching unit. If a student misses between 15% and 30%, the lecturer may offer a skills-oriented substitute achievement to fulfil the attendance requirement; if no such substitute is offered or completed, attendance is deemed irregular. If more than 30% of instruction time is missed, the teaching unit must be taken again. For excursions, placements and block seminars, 100% attendance is usually required, with limited substitute options up to 15% absence for reasons beyond the student’s control. Attendance is checked via attendance lists which students must sign.\",\n",
    "    \"Examinations must be taken in such a timely manner that students can acquire the ECTS credits specified in the degree programme and examination regulations for the GOP and for the Bachelor’s or Master’s examination by the scheduled deadlines. The standard deadlines are: the second semester of the Bachelor’s programme for the GOP and the last semester of the standard duration of study for the Bachelor’s and Master’s examinations. These deadlines may be exceeded by one semester for the GOP, two semesters for the Bachelor’s examination and two semesters for the Master’s examination (extended deadlines). If a student does not obtain the required number of ECTS credits within the relevant extended deadline and the reasons are not beyond their control, the corresponding examination is deemed to have been taken and failed at the final attempt. Deadlines are automatically extended by legally protected periods such as maternity protection, parental leave and periods of caregiving for close family members as defined in the relevant German laws. Reasons for exceeding deadlines or for being unable to sit an examination (e.g. illness) must be reported to the Examinations Office or the examiner without delay, usually supported by an official medical certificate; if accepted, examinations must then be taken at the next possible date.\",\n",
    "    \"With the exception of the GOP and the Bachelor’s thesis in the Bachelor’s programme and the theses in the Master’s programme, every module examination or partial module examination may be resat twice, meaning students normally have up to three attempts for each such examination. Examinations that form part of the GOP may only be resat once. The resit examination must usually be taken at the next possible date, typically in the following semester, and the student is considered automatically registered; missing this resit without approved reasons leads to the examination being deemed failed. A Bachelor’s thesis graded ‘nicht ausreichend’ (unsatisfactory) may be repeated once with a new subject; a second repetition or revision is not allowed. Similarly, a Master’s thesis that is rejected or deemed rejected may be repeated once with a new subject; a second repetition is not permitted, although in some cases a revision of the rejected thesis may be allowed within two months if it was not rejected for fraud or plagiarism. Voluntarily resitting an examination that has already been passed in the same module is explicitly not permitted.\",\n",
    "    \"Examinations are graded using the following scale: ‘sehr gut’ (very good; 1.0 or 1.3) for outstanding achievements, ‘gut’ (good; 1.7, 2.0 or 2.3) for achievements that considerably exceed requirements, ‘befriedigend’ (satisfactory; 2.7, 3.0 or 3.3) for average achievements, ‘ausreichend’ (sufficient; 3.7 or 4.0) for achievements that meet requirements despite flaws, and ‘nicht ausreichend’ (unsatisfactory; 4.3, 4.7 or 5.0) for achievements that no longer fulfil requirements due to considerable flaws. An examination is passed if it receives at least the grade ‘ausreichend’ (4.0). Ungraded examinations are assessed only as ‘bestanden’ (pass) or ‘nicht bestanden’ (fail). When a module examination consists of several parts or has several examiners, the total grade is calculated as a weighted average of the individual grades, with one decimal place kept without rounding. Multiple-choice examinations are evaluated based on the proportion of correctly answered questions or achieved points after meeting a minimum threshold, with grades 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 or 4.0 assigned to specific percentage ranges and intermediate steps of 0.3 allowed (except for 0.7, 4.3 and 4.7 in certain cases). The overall grade for the Bachelor’s and Master’s examinations is derived from the weighted average (by ECTS credits) of all module grades: up to 1.5 is ‘sehr gut’, over 1.5 to 2.5 is ‘gut’, over 2.5 to 3.5 is ‘befriedigend’, over 3.5 to 4.0 is ‘ausreichend’, and over 4.0 is ‘nicht ausreichend’.

It omits the exceptions for the Elite Master’s program Integrated Immunology and the Departments of Mathematics and Physics, which are mentioned in the gold answer.\n",

      "  ❗ Justification: The RAG answer correctly states that FAU does not provide accommodation but offers information and links, and it mentions the semester fee and lack of direct financial support, aligning with the gold answer. However, it adds extensive information about job opportunities, career prospects, mentoring, and doctoral studies that are not mentioned in the gold answer, and it omits the specific mention of the Stellenwerk job portal and the email contact for job offers. This extra information is not necessarily incorrect but goes beyond the gold answer, and the omission of the Stellenwerk portal and job mailing list is a notable gap.\n",

It omits the specific condition of working longer than four weeks and the direct relation to Data Science tasks. While it correctly mentions approval by the examination committee and the need for documentation, it adds complexity and some inaccuracies compared to the gold answer, making it less aligned and somewhat misleading.\n",

      "  ❗ Justification: The RAG answer contradicts the gold answer by stating it is possible to improve the overall grade after reaching 120 ECTS credits, while the gold answer clearly states that once the required credits are obtained, no further grade improvement is possible. The RAG answer introduces the concept of additional modules and grade selection, which is not supported by the gold answer and appears to be incorrect or misleading.\n",
