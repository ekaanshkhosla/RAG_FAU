(3) 1The teaching and examination language in the Bachelor’s degree programme is German. 2Individual modules may be taught and assessed in English. 3Further details are stipulated in the degree programme and examination regulations and the module handbook. 4In any case of uncertainty, the examination language shall be the same as the teaching language. 5The degree programme and examination regulations can stipulate provisions deviating from sentences 1 and 2 and allow for other teaching and examination languages.  
(4) The degree programme shall begin in the winter semester.  

## Section 4 Structure of the Master’s Degree Programme, Standard Duration of Study, Teaching and Examination Language, Starting Date

(1) The Master’s degree programme builds on the contents of the Bachelor’s programme; it is more research-oriented.  
(2) 1The Master’s degree programme shall have a duration of three semesters plus one semester for working on the Master’s thesis. 2To complete the programme successfully, students shall achieve 120 ECTS credits, which include all required module examinations and the Master’s thesis module.  
(3) The standard duration of the Master’s degree programme is four semesters.  
(4) If students have the choice between several modules, they shall choose modules that may be studied without overlap within the context of an individual study agreement after consulting a study or subject advisor.  
(5) 1The teaching and examination language in the Master’s degree programme is German. 2Individual modules may be taught and assessed in English. Further details are stipulated in the degree programme and examination regulations and the module handbook. 3In any case of uncertainty, the examination language shall be the same as the teaching language. 4The degree programme and examination regulations can stipulate provisions deviating from sentences 1 and 2 and allow for other teaching and examination languages.  
(6) The Master’s degree programme may be started in the winter semester or in the summer semester, unless stipulated otherwise in the applicable degree programme and examinations regulations.  

## Section 5 ECTS Credits

(1) 1The degree program and examinations are based on the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). 2 30 ECTS credits are allocated per semester. 3One ECTS credit corresponds to 30 hours of work.  
(2) 1ECTS credits serve as a system to categorize, calculate and confirm the amount of work a student has invested. 2They are a quantitative indicator of a student’s workload.  

## Section 6 Modules and Credits, Voluntary Intermediate Examinations

(1) 1The degree programme consists of modules for which students are awarded ECTS credits. 2One module is a chronologically connected and self-contained teaching and learning unit, the content of which can be tested in an examination.  
(2) 1The modules shall be completed with a module examination. 2This examination shall as a rule consist of one examination achievement or one course achievement. 3In exceptional cases, this examination can also consist of several partial examinations or parts of examinations or a combination of examination and course achievements if the subject warrants it. 4Ungraded course achievements consisting of several parts and/or course achievements which can be repeated an unlimited number of times shall not count as examinations consisting of several parts as defined in sentence 3. 5ECTS credits shall only be awarded for successful participation in modules that can be verified in an individual, separately identifiable performance in a module examination. 6Module examinations are conducted during the lecture period or following the last lecture/seminar of a module before the start of the next semester’s lecture period.  
(3) 1Examinations (examination achievements and course achievements) measure the student’s performance. 2They may be in writing, oral, electronic or in a different form specific to the subject (e.g. tutorial achievements, practical achievements, seminar achievements). 3In the event of invigilated remote electronic examinations, the Bavarian regulation for testing remote examinations (BayFEV) and the FAU regulations on remote examinations on the basis of the Bavarian regulations for testing remote examinations (BayFEV) – EFernPO – shall be complied with. 4Examination achievements are graded. 5The assessment of course achievements may be limited to determining whether the student has passed or not.  
(4) 1Tutorial achievements (TA) generally involve independently solving exercises each week (e.g. exercises in programming or calculations, or e-learning units, which are assessed on the basis of an exercise log, compilation or electronic record). 2Practical achievements (PA) generally involve completing practical tasks, documenting them in a series of reports and completing oral or written tests on the practical task at hand. 3Students may also be required to complete seminar achievements (SEA) (generally a presentation and handout). 4The specific form and scope of the examinations stated in sentences 1 to 3 depend on the specific manner in which the respective module or teaching unit is taught. Details are stipulated in (5), the applicable degree programme and examination regulations and/or the module handbook.  
(5) 1The scope of a seminar achievement pursuant to (4)(3) depends on the specific topic which has been allocated and shall be agreed with the module coordinator. 2Unless stipulated otherwise in the relevant degree programme and examination regulations, the presentation shall generally last approximately 30 to 80 minutes and the handout shall be approximately 5 to 25 pages long.  
(6) 1In addition to the module examinations, voluntary intermediate examinations (e.g. tutorial achievements, short tests or homework assignments) may be offered during teaching units as a way of measuring the standard of performance. 2More detailed information, including the number, type and scope of these examinations, is given in the module handbook. 3An intermediate examination achievement may improve the grade for a passed module examination or partial examination by a maximum of 0.7; a grade may not be made worse. 4If a student chooses to use the option detailed in sentence 1, these results shall be taken into account when determining the grade for the module.  
(7) Enrolment in the relevant degree programme at FAU is a requirement for participation in module examinations according to (2)(1). This shall not apply to resit examinations within the meaning of Sections 30 and 35.  

## Section 7 Compulsory Attendance

(1) 1For teaching units, which are marked accordingly in the respective module description, in which the qualification goal can only be achieved by regular attendance, compulsory attendance can be made a requirement for admission to the module examination or for obtaining the course achievement. 2If attendance of the individual student is required for all participants to obtain the subject-specific skills, if the individual student obtaining such skills depends on the attendance of the other participants, or if subject-specific skills can only be obtained by being present at a particular place, or if participation is required for safety reasons, it is permissible to introduce an obligation to attend.  
(2) 1Regular attendance is defined as missing no more than 15% of instruction time in any given teaching unit. 2If between 15% and 30% of instruction time has been missed, the lecturer can offer the student the option to obtain a skills-orientated substitute achievement fulfilling the requirement of regular attendance. If no such substitute achievements are offered or the substitute achievements offered are not obtained by the student, attendance is not considered to have been regular. 3If more than 30% of all instruction time has been missed, the teaching unit must be taken again. 4Any positions after the decimal point in the percentage of instruction time missed shall be rounded for the benefit of the student.  
(3) 1Notwithstanding paragraph 2, in the context of excursions, placements and block seminars, attendance is only considered to have been regular if all teaching units have been attended. 2Appropriate substitute achievements fulfilling the requirement of regular attendance shall be offered in the case of credibly shown periods of absence due to reasons beyond the student’s control of up to and including 15% of instruction time. 3If more than 15% of instruction time has been missed, the teaching unit must be taken again. 4Any positions after the decimal point in the percentage of instruction time missed shall be rounded for the benefit of the student.  
(4) Attendance is checked in the individual teaching units by means of an attendance list in which students must enter their name and signature.  

## Section 8 Examination Deadlines, Failure to Observe Deadlines

(1) 1Examinations shall be sat in such a timely manner as to allow the student to obtain the ECTS credits specified in the degree programme and examination regulations for the GOP and the Bachelor’s or Master’s examination by the scheduled deadline. 2Deadlines shall be the second semester of the Bachelor’s degree programme for the GOP and the last semester of the respective standard duration of study for the Bachelor’s or Master’s examination. 3The deadlines according to sentence 2 may be exceeded by the following periods (extended deadline):  
1. GOP – by one semester  
2. Bachelor’s examination – by two semesters  
3. Master’s examination – by two semesters  
4An examination shall be considered to have been sat and failed at the final attempt if the required number of ECTS credits stipulated in the degree programme and examination regulations was not obtained within the extended deadline according to sentence 3, unless the reasons for this are beyond the student’s control.  
(2) The deadline set forth in paragraph (1) shall be extended by claiming the legal periods of protection stipulated in the law protecting mothers at work, in education and whilst studying, the Maternity Protection Act (Mutterschutzgesetz – MuSchG) in the version published on 23 May 2017 (BGBI I S. 1228 [German Federal Law Gazette I p.2318]), according to the periods set forth in the current version of the Parental Allowance and Parental Leave Act (Bundeselterngeld- und Elternzeitgesetz – BEEG) of December 5, 2006 (BGBl I S. 2748 [German Federal Law Gazette I p. 2748]), and according to periods of time spent providing care in the sense of Section 7 (3) of the current version of the Caregiver Leave Act (Pflegezeitgesetz - PflegeZG) of 28 May 2008 (BGBI I S. 874, 896 [German Federal Law Gazette I p. 874, 896]) for a close family member who requires care in the sense of the current version of SGB XI (German Social Security Code XI) of May 26, 1994 (BGBI I S. 1014, 1015 [German Federal Law Gazette I p. 1014, 1015]).  
(3) 1The reasons according to (1)(4) and (2) shall be explained in writing and shown credibly to the Examinations Office without delay. 2If the reasons are acknowledged, the examination shall be sat at the soonest possible time; previous examination and course achievements shall be accredited. 3In case of an incapability to sit the examination occurring before or during the examination, the examiner shall be notified immediately; in cases where the student is unable to sit an examination due to illness, an official doctor’s certificate shall be submitted at the same time. 4The Examinations Committee may require the student to submit a certificate from an official medical examiner (vertrauensärztliches Attest).  

## Section 9 Examinations Committee

(1) 1An Examinations Committee shall be appointed to organise the examinations. 2An Examinations Committee consisting of five members of the Department of Mathematics or the Department of Data Science shall be appointed for the Bachelor’s degree programmes in Mathematics, Industrial Mathematics, and Economics and Mathematics as well as for the Master’s degree programmes in Mathematics, Computational and Applied Mathematics and Economics and Mathematics. 3The chairperson, their deputy and the further members of the Examinations Committee shall be professors at the Department of Mathematics or the Department of Data Science appointed by the Faculty Council of the Faculty of Sciences based on the recommendation of the Department of Mathematics or the Department of Data Science. 4An Examinations Committee consisting of two members of the Department of Mathematics or the Department of Data Science at the Faculty of Sciences and one member of the Department of Computer Science at the Faculty of Engineering shall be appointed for the Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programmes in Data Science. 5The chairperson and one other member of the Examinations Committee shall be professors of the Department of Mathematics or the Department of Data Science, the deputy of the Examinations Committee shall be a professor of the Department of Computer Science and all members shall be appointed by the Faculty Council of the Faculty of Sciences based on each department’s recommendation. 6The term of office of the members of each Examinations Committee shall be two years. 7Re-election shall be permitted.

## Section 13 Accreditation of Skills

(1) 1Study periods, modules, course and examination achievements achieved in other degree programmes at FAU or at other public or state-approved universities in the Federal Republic of Germany, through successful participation in a distance course as part of a degree programme at a public or state-approved university in the Federal Republic of Germany, or in degree programmes at foreign universities shall be accredited according to these examination regulations unless there are significant differences in the skills acquired. 2The same shall apply to study periods, course and examination achievements achieved at a public or state-approved university in Bavaria in the course of other study programmes within the meaning of Section 56 (6)(1) and (2) BayHSchG, in special study programmes within the meaning of Section 47 (3)(1) BayHSchG, or at the Virtual University of Bavaria.  
(2) 1Skills acquired in programmes for professional development as defined by Section 56 (6)(3) BayHSchG, or outside of higher education shall be accredited if they are equivalent to skills acquired through university studies. 2Skills acquired outside the university sector shall replace no more than half of the required skills of which students must provide proof.  
(3) 1The grades achieved in approved modules, examinations and course achievements shall be transferred if they were awarded according to Section 20 and are recognised as equivalent according to the recommendations in the anabin database (information portal for the recognition of foreign qualifications offered by the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs (KMK)). 2If the grading system which is applied to examinations sat at a university or equivalent institution of higher education and accredited by FAU is deemed to be equivalent according to sentence 1 but is not identical to the grading system set forth in Section 20, the grades achieved at other universities are usually converted according to the following formula:  
\[
x = 1 + 3 \frac{N_{\text{max}} - N_d}{N_{\text{max}} - N_{\text{min}}}
\]  
with  
\(x\) = converted grade  
\(N_{\text{max}}\) = best grade attainable  
\(N_{\text{min}}\) = lowest grade for passing  
\(N_d\) = grade attained  
3Only one decimal place is shown for the grades thus calculated. 4If conversion is not possible, the Examinations Committee usually determines a system by which to calculate the grades.  
(4) 1The documents needed for this accreditation shall be submitted to the chairperson of the Examinations Committee. 2Subject to the provisions in sentence 3, the student shall have a legal claim to accreditation if the conditions stipulated in (1) and (2) are met. 3Accreditation is only possible if the student has not already lost the right to be examined in that subject at FAU by passing or failing to pass the relevant examination at the final attempt. 4If a student requests accreditation, the decision shall rest with the chairperson of the Examinations Committee after consultation with the subject representative appointed by the department; the decision shall be issued in writing.  

## Section 14 Consequences of Delayed Withdrawal, Breach of Regulations, Fraud, Exclusion from Further Participation

(1) 1An examination achievement shall be graded as ‘nicht ausreichend’ (unsatisfactory; 5.0) if the student withdraws from the examination after the withdrawal period (cf. Section 11 (3)) without good reasons. Section 8 (3) shall not be affected. 2Section 11 (3) sentences 2 to 5 shall apply accordingly. 3If the Examinations Committee accepts the reasons, the examination must be sat on the next possible date.  
(2) In case of an attempt to commit fraud or to influence the result of an examination through the use of unauthorised materials, the examination in question shall be graded ‘nicht ausreichend’ (unsatisfactory, 5.0).  

# Page 11

(3) Persons who disturb the orderly examination process may be excluded from continuing the examination by the authorised examiner or the supervising person; in this case the examination achievement in question shall be graded ‘nicht ausreichend’ (unsatisfactory, 5.0).  
(4) In case of a repeated or severe breach of regulations in the sense of (1) or (2), the Examinations Committee may exclude students from further participation in the examination.  

## Section 15 Revocation of Degrees

The revocation of Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees shall be governed by Section 69 BayHSchG.  

## Section 16 Faults in the Examination Process

(1) Should it turn out that the examination process was faulty in a manner that influenced the result of the examination, it shall be ordered upon a student’s request that a certain student or all students shall resit the examination or parts of the same.  
(2) Faults in the examination process shall be reported to the chairperson of the Examinations Committee or the examiner without delay.  
(3) Six months after completion of the examination, resit examinations may no longer be ordered as stipulated in paragraph (1).  

## Section 17 Written Examination, Change in Examination Form, Multiple Choice Examinations

(1) 1In written examinations students are required to prove that they are capable of identifying a problem within a limited period and with limited materials, using the conventional methods employed in their field, and to find a solution to this problem. 2Written examination achievements may take the form of written examinations, multiple choice examinations, written assignments, seminar papers or electronic examinations. 3Written examinations may also be held as open book examinations during which students have to complete one or several tasks in a certain time without supervision using either a wide range of aids or whichever aids they like, but without the assistance of third parties. Further details are stipulated in the module description. 4In the case of examinations as defined in sentence 2, tasks shall as far as possible be tailored to test higher-level skills such as understanding, analysis, transfer and application.  
(2) 1Changing the examination form from an (electronic) written examination to an oral examination may be possible in exceptional circumstances after the semester has started if the respective degree programme and examination regulations allow for both forms of examinations and the teaching concept of a module has been changed accordingly at short notice. 2The decision shall be taken by the module coordinator. 3They shall inform students at the latest two weeks after lectures begin if the examination is to be an oral examination instead of an (electronic) written examination. 4The form of the resit examination in semesters in which the teaching unit is not held shall follow the form taken by the examination in the semester in which the teaching unit was last held. 5Resit examinations in semesters in which the teaching unit is held shall follow the examination form chosen for the semester in question. 6Students who are unable to attend a written examination on the regular date as they are completing a semester abroad may, in consultation with the respective examiner, apply for an alternative date for an oral examination, provided the change of examination form is compatible with the learning outcome of the module. 7The decision shall be taken by the Examinations Committee. 8Proof of the intended study stay abroad must be submitted together with the application.

Qualification assessment process for the Master’s degree programmes in Data Science, Mathematics, Computational and Applied Mathematics and Economics and Mathematics at the Faculty of Sciences at FAU.

(1) The qualification assessment process for the relevant Master’s degree programme shall be carried out once before the start of the lecture period of the semester preceding the regular start of a degree programme.  
(2) 1Applications for the qualification assessment process must be submitted to the Master’s Office by 15 July for the winter semester and 15 January for the summer semester. 2The application shall include:  
1. A certificate proving that the applicant holds a university degree according to Section 31 (1)(1)(1) (final academic record, transcript of records, diploma supplement or comparable documents)  
2. For applicants who have not yet obtained their Bachelor’s degree (Section 31(3)): a transcript of records demonstrating that at least 140 ECTS credits have been obtained  
3. Where applicable, further documents as proof of fulfilment of the requirements set forth in the relevant degree programme and examination regulations.  
(3) 1In accordance with Section 12, qualification assessment shall be the responsibility of the Admissions Committee. 2The Admissions Committee may transfer the task of coordinating and carrying out the process to individual members unless otherwise stated. 3The Admissions Committee shall fulfil its obligations in cooperation with the Master’s Office.  
(4) 1Admission to the qualification assessment process shall be subject to the timely and complete submission of the documents listed in paragraph (2). 2The qualification assessment process shall be carried out with those applicants who fulfil the requirements according to the provisions in paragraph (5). 3Applicants who are rejected shall receive a rejection notification including reasons and information on legal remedies available.  
(5) 1Unless stipulated otherwise in the degree programme and examination regulations, the qualification assessment process shall be conducted in accordance with the following provisions. 2The Admissions Committee shall select applicants based on the submitted documents as part of the qualification assessment process to assess whether they are qualified for a Master’s degree programme. 3The Admissions Committee shall deem the applicant qualified based on submitted documents if the final grade of the subject-specific or subject-related/equivalent degree fulfils the provisions under Section 31 (1)(1)(1), sentence 2 or in the case of Section 31 (3) if the student has achieved an average of 3.0 (satisfactory) or better in their previous achievements; for degrees graded on the basis of a different grading system Section 13 (3) sentences 1 to 3 shall apply accordingly. 4Applicants who cannot be admitted to the Master’s degree programme on the basis of their submitted qualifications alone shall be invited to a selection interview. 5Sentence 2 notwithstanding, individual degree programme and examination regulations can specify whether candidates with a degree from a related subject or an equivalent degree shall have to pass an oral admission examination before they can be admitted to the Master’s degree  
programme. 6The date of the selection interview shall be announced at least one week in advance. 7If an applicant should be unable to attend due to reasons beyond their control, a second date may be set upon justified request up until two weeks before the start of the lecture period. 8The oral admission examination is an individual interview which lasts approximately 20 minutes. 9With the applicant’s approval, the oral admission examination may be conducted as a video conference. 10It shall be conducted by two university lecturers from the Department of Mathematics or the Department of Data Science appointed by the Admissions Committee. Section 18 (4) shall apply accordingly. 11The oral admission examination is intended to demonstrate in particular that the applicant possesses the required technical and methodological expertise and can be expected to carry out independent academic work in a more research-oriented degree programme; the individual degree programme and examination regulations shall specify the criteria of the examination. 12The result of the oral admission examination and the qualification assessment process will be given as ‘bestanden’ (pass) or ‘nicht bestanden’ (fail). 13Applicants will be notified of the result in writing. 14A rejection notification shall include reasons and information on the legal remedies available. 15It will not be possible to repeat the qualification assessment process on the basis of the documentation submitted with the first application.  
(6) Applicants shall bear their own costs of the qualification assessment process.  
(7) Confirmation of passing the qualification assessment process shall remain valid indefinitely, provided that the Master’s degree programme has not been changed significantly.
