otherwise, (5)(3) of the Appendix to ABMPOMathe/NatFak shall remain unaffected.
2The average grade shall be calculated by weighting the grades of the achievements
according to the weighting of the ECTS credits in the individual modules; achievements
in modules with more credits shall therefore have more weighting than modules with
fewer credits. 3Notwithstanding (5)(4) of the Appendix to ABMPOMathe/NatFak, only
those applicants shall be invited to the oral admission examination whose average
grade in modules related to mathematics and computer science in their undergraduate
degree that is subject-specific, subject-related or relevant to the specific Master’s
degree program or another equivalent German or non-German qualification with
equivalent content pursuant to Section 31 (1)(1)(1), Section 31 sentence 2 or Section
31 (3) is worse than 2.5 (good), but at least 2.8 (satisfactory).
(4) In the oral admission examination according to Section 5 (4) et seq. of the Appendix
