# Page 4

(5) The Master’s degree program may be started in the winter semester or in the
summer semester, unless stipulated otherwise in the applicable degree program and
examinations regulations.
Section 5 ECTS Credits
(1) 1The degree programs and examinations are based on the European Credit
Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). 230 ECTS credits are allocated per
semester. 3One ECTS credit corresponds to 30 hours of work.
(2) 1ECTS credits serve as a system to categorize, calculate and confirm the amount
of work a student has invested. 2They are a quantitative indicator of a student’s
workload.
Section 6 Modules and Credits,
Voluntary Intermediate Examinations, Safety Briefing
(1) 1The degree program consists of modules for which students are awarded ECTS
credits. 2One module is a chronologically connected and self-contained teaching and
learning unit, the content of which can be tested in an examination.
(2) 1The modules shall be completed with a module examination. 2This examination
shall as a rule consist of one examination achievement or one course achievement.
3In exceptional cases, this examination can also consist of several partial examinations
or parts of examinations or a combination of examination and/or course achievements
if the subject warrants it. 4Ungraded course achievements consisting of several parts
and/or course achievements which can be repeated an unlimited number of times shall
not count as examinations consisting of several parts as defined in sentence 3. 5ECTS
credits shall only be awarded for successful participation in modules that can be
verified in an individual, separately identifiable performance in a module examination.
6Module examinations are conducted during the lecture period or following the last
lecture/seminar of a module before the start of the next semester’s lecture period.
(3) 1Examinations (examination achievements and course achievements) measure the
student’s performance. 2They may be in writing, oral, electronic or in a different form
specific to the subject (e. g. tutorial achievements, practical achievements, seminar
achievements, excursion achievements). 3In the event of invigilated remote electronic
examinations, the Bavarian regulation for testing remote examinations (BayFEV) and
the FAU regulations on remote examinations on the basis of the Bavarian regulations
for testing remote examinations (BayFEV) – EFernPO – shall be complied with.
4Examination achievements are graded. 4The assessment of course achievements
may be limited to determining whether the student has passed (“bestanden”) or failed
(“nicht bestanden”).
(4) 1Tutorial achievements (TA) generally involve independently solving exercises
each week (e. g. exercises in programming or calculations, or e-learning units, which
are assessed on the basis of an exercise log, compilation or electronic record).
2Practical achievements (PA) generally involve completing practical tasks,
documenting them in a series of reports and completing oral or written tests on the
practical task at hand. 3Furthermore, students may be required to submit seminar
achievements (SA) (usually a presentation and written report) and excursion
achievements (ExA) (usually a review, contribution to a discussion or reports). 4The
specific form and scope of the examinations stated in sentences 1 to 3 depend on the
specific manner in which the respective module or teaching unit is taught. Details are
4

# Page 5

stipulated in paragraph (5) of the applicable degree program and examination
regulations and/or the module handbook.
(5) 1The scope of a seminar achievement pursuant to (4)(3) depends on the specific
topic which has been allocated and shall be agreed with the module coordinator.
2Unless stipulated otherwise in the relevant degree program and examination
regulations, the presentation shall generally last approximately 30 minutes and the
handout shall be approximately 10 pages long.
(6) 1In addition to the module examinations, voluntary intermediate examinations (e. g.
paper and computer exercises, presentations) may be offered during courses as a way
of measuring the standard of performance. 2More detailed information, including the
number, type and scope of these examinations, is given in the module handbook. 3If a
student chooses to use the option detailed in sentence 1, these results shall be taken
into account when determining the grade for the module. 4Intermediate examination
achievements may improve the grade for a module examination or partial examination
by a maximum of 0.7; a grade may not be made worse.
(7) 1Tests to verify that students have mastered the safety skills required for practical
exercises or experiments in the laboratory do not count as examinations as defined in
the paragraphs above, as they do not serve to determine whether or not students have
mastered the skills which must be acquired in a module. 2Checking these basic safety-
related skills is not comparable to an examination as defined above and simply
constitutes a basic entry requirement which must be met before students can take part
in practical exercises or experiments in the laboratory in order to ensure the safety of
everyone participating in the teaching unit and to protect the facilities. 3Modules for
which an entry requirement such as this must be met shall be labeled accordingly in
the module description.
(8) Enrollment in the relevant degree program at FAU is a requirement for participation
in module examinations according to paragraph (2)(1).
Section 7 Compulsory Attendance
(1) 1For teaching units, which are marked accordingly in the respective module
description, in which the qualification goal can only be achieved by regular attendance,
compulsory attendance can be made a requirement for admission to the module
examination or for obtaining the course achievement. 2If attendance of the individual
student is required for all participants to obtain the subject-specific skills, if the
individual student obtaining such skills depends on the attendance of the other
participants, or if subject-specific skills can only be obtained by being present at a
particular place, or if participation is required for safety reasons, it is permissible to
introduce an obligation to attend.
(2) 1Regular attendance is defined as missing no more than 15% of instruction time in
any given teaching unit. 2If between 15% and 30% of instruction time has been missed,
the lecturer can offer the student the option to obtain a substitute achievement fulfilling
the requirement of regular attendance. If no such substitute achievements are offered
or the substitute achievements offered are not obtained by the student, attendance is
not considered to have been regular. 3If more than 30% of all instruction time has been
missed, the teaching unit must be taken again. 4Any positions after the decimal point
in the percentage of instruction time missed shall be rounded for the benefit of the
student.
5

# Page 6

(3) 1In deviation from paragraph 2, in the context of excursions, practical courses,
laboratory courses and block seminars, attendance is only considered to have been
regular if all teaching units have been attended. 2Appropriate substitute achievements
fulfilling the requirement of regular attendance shall be offered in the case of credibly
shown periods of absence due to reasons beyond the student’s control of up to and
including 15% of instruction time. 3If more than 15% of instruction time has been
missed, the teaching unit must be taken again. 4Any positions after the decimal point
in the percentage of instruction time missed shall be rounded for the benefit of the
student.
(4) 1Attendance is checked in the individual teaching units, provided these are held
face to face, by means of an attendance list in which students must enter their name
and signature. 2If teaching units are held online, teaching staff shall record attendance
by taking a register of the names of all those attending. 3Teaching staff shall compare
the names on the registration list to see whether they correspond with the names used
by the students attending the teaching unit. 4If students use a pseudonym during an
online teaching unit with compulsory attendance, they must inform the member of
teaching staff of their real name in order to allow a comparison to be made.
Section 8 Examination Deadlines, Failure to Observe Deadlines
(1) 1Examinations shall be sat in such a timely manner as to allow the student to obtain
the ECTS credits specified in the relevant degree program and examination
regulations for the GOP and the Bachelor’s or Master’s examination by the scheduled
deadline. 2Deadlines shall be the second semester of the Bachelor’s degree program
for the GOP and the last semester of the respective standard duration of study for the
Bachelor’s or Master’s examination. 3The deadlines according to sentence 2 may be
exceeded by the following periods (extended deadline):
1. GOP – by one semester
2. Bachelor’s examination – by two semesters
3. Master’s examination – by one semester.
4An examination shall be considered to have been sat and failed at the final attempt if
the required number of ECTS credits stipulated in the relevant degree program and
examination regulations was not obtained within the extended deadline according to
Sentence 3, unless the reasons for this are beyond the student’s control.
(2) The deadline set forth in paragraph (1) shall be extended by claiming the legal
periods of protection stipulated in the law protecting mothers at work, in education and
whilst studying, the Maternity Protection Act (Mutterschutzgesetz – MuSchG) in the
version published on May 23, 2017 (BGBI I S. 1228 [German Federal Law Gazette I
p.2318]), according to the periods set forth in the current version of the Parental
Allowance and Parental Leave Act (Bundeselterngeld- und Elternzeitgesetz – BEEG)
of December 5, 2006 (BGBl I S. 2748 [German Federal Law Gazette I p. 2748]), and
according to periods of time spent providing care in the sense of Section 7 (3) of the
current version of the Caregiver Leave Act (Pflegezeitgesetz - PflegeZG) of 28 May
2008 (BGBI I S. 874, 896 [German Federal Law Gazette I p. 874, 896]) for a close
family member who requires care in the sense of the current version of SGB XI
(German Social Security Code XI) of 26 May 1994 (BGBI I S. 1014, 1015 [German
Federal Law Gazette I p. 1014, 1015]).

practice four weeks in advance. 3In order to sit the examination, students must register
correctly on the provided platform.
(3) 1Notwithstanding the deadlines set forth in Sections 8 and 32, withdrawal from first
attempts at examinations for which students have registered pursuant to (2) shall be
permitted without stating reasons up until the end of the third working day before the
examination date; withdrawals are to be submitted to the examiner. The days between
and including Monday and Friday shall be considered working days. 2In cases where
the student is unable to sit an examination due to illness, a certificate from an official
medical examiner (vertrauensärztliches Attest) may be required by the Examinations
Committee responsible. 3The doctor’s certificate or certificate from an official medical
examiner must include a description of the student’s ailment and state how this affects
the student’s ability to perform to their full potential during the examination, especially
due to a reduction in their physical or mental capacity. 4In case of withdrawal from an
examination due to illness after the examination has started (termination of an
examination), the student must submit a certificate from an official medical examiner
to the Examinations Office without delay. 5Once a student has declared that they wish
to withdraw they may not revoke this declaration; registration to the examination on
this date shall be canceled once the declaration is submitted and the student shall no
longer be entitled to take the examination. 6Students shall only be able to register for
and sit the examination in a later semester. 7The consequences of a delayed or invalid

Section 13 Recognition and Accreditation of Skills
(1) 1Study periods, and course and examination achievements achieved in degree
programs or by successfully taking part in a distance learning unit as part of a degree
program at FAU or at other public or state-approved universities in the Federal
Republic of Germany, or in degree programs at public or state approved universities
in countries other than Germany shall be recognized according to these examination
regulations unless there are significant differences in the skills acquired and required.
2The same shall apply to course and examination achievements obtained at a public
or state approved university in Bavaria within the context of a module program or
additional studies, at the Virtual University of Bavaria (vhb), or within the context of an
early entrance program or university studies started while still at school. 3Recognition
enables students to continue their studies, to take examinations, to start a further
degree program or to be admitted to a doctoral degree.
(2) 1Skills acquired outside the university sector or within the context of degree
programs for professional development or for acquiring further qualifications may be
accredited if they are equivalent. 2Skills acquired outside the university sector shall
replace no more than half of the required skills of which students must provide proof.
(3) 1The grades achieved in recognized or accredited modules, examinations and
course achievements shall be transferred if they were awarded according to
Section 22. 2If the grading system applied in the examinations sat at the university or
equivalent institution of higher education and accredited or recognized by FAU is not
identical to the grading system set forth in Section 22, the grades achieved at other
universities shall usually be converted according to the following formula:
x= 1 + 3 (N – N )/(N – N ) with
max d max min
x = converted grade
N = best grade attainable
max
N = lowest grade for passing
min
N = grade attained.
d
3Only one decimal place is shown for the grades thus calculated. 4If conversion is not
possible, the Examinations Committee responsible usually determines a system by
which to calculate the grades.
(4) 1If 30 or more ECTS credits are recognized or accredited, the student shall be
permitted to enter at a higher semester. 2Students shall move up one semester for
every 30 ECTS credits that are accredited. 3Sentences 1 and 2 shall apply to part-time
studies with the proviso that students move up one semester after half of the credits
stated in sentences 1 and 2 are accredited or recognized.
(5) 1Students must file an application for recognition and accreditation. 2The
documents needed for this accreditation shall be submitted to the chairperson of the
Examinations Committee. 3Subject to the provisions in sentence 4, the student shall
have a legal claim to accreditation or recognition if the conditions stipulated in (1) and
(2) are met. 3Accreditation or recognition is only possible if the student has not already
lost the right to be examined in that subject at FAU by passing or failing to pass the
relevant examination at the final attempt. 4The decision shall rest with the chairperson
of the Examinations Committee after consultation with the department representative
appointed by the department in question; the decision shall be issued in writing.

Section 14 Consequences of Delayed Withdrawal, Breach of Regulations,
Fraud, Exclusion from Further Participation
(1) 1An examination shall be graded as ‘nicht ausreichend’ (unsatisfactory) if the
student fails to attend an examination on the examination date without good reasons
or if the student withdraws from the examination after the withdrawal deadline (Section
11 (3)) without good reasons; Section 8 (3) shall remain unaffected. 2The reasons for
withdrawal or absence according to sentence 1 shall be explained in writing and shown
credibly to the Examinations Office without delay. Section 11 (3) sentences 2 to 4 shall
apply accordingly. 3If the Examinations Committee accepts the reasons, the
examination must be sat on the next possible date.
(2) 1In case of plagiarism or an attempt to commit fraud or to influence the result of an
examination through the use of unauthorized aids, the examination in question shall
be graded “nicht ausreichend” (unsatisfactory, 5.0). 2Unauthorized aids for completing
examination or course achievements pursuant to sentence 1 include in particular the
use of chatbots or other artificial intelligence that is capable of replacing the student’s
own performance, unless this is expressly permitted by the examiner.
(3) Persons who disturb the orderly examination process may be excluded from
continuing the examination in question by the authorized examiner or the supervising
person; in this case the examination achievement in question shall be considered to
be “nicht ausreichend” (unsatisfactory; 5.0).
(4) In the case of repeated or severe breaches as stipulated in (2) or (3), the
Examinations Committee may exclude students from participating in the examination,
resulting in the student losing the right of examination in the relevant module (failed at
the final attempt).
Section 15 Revocation of Degrees
The revocation of Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees shall be governed by Section 101
BayHIG.
Section 16 Faults in the Examination Process
(1) Should it turn out that the examination process was faulty in a manner that
influenced the result of the examination, it shall be ordered upon a student’s request
that a certain student or all students shall resit the examination or parts of the same.
(2) Faults in the examination process shall be reported to the chairperson of the
Examinations Committee or the examiner without delay.
(3) Six months after completion of the examination, resit examinations may no longer
be ordered as stipulated in paragraph (1).
Section 17 Written Examination, Multiple Choice Examinations
(1) 1In written examinations students are required to prove that they are capable of
identifying a problem within a limited period and with limited materials, using the
conventional methods employed in their field, and to find a solution to this problem.
2This applies in particular to invigilated written examinations (Klausur). 3With the
exception of a traditional written examination (Klausur), written examinations may also
be held as open book examinations during which students have to complete one or
several tasks in a certain time without supervision using either a wide range of aids or
11

# Page 12

whichever aids they like, but without the assistance of third parties. Further details are
stipulated in the module description. 4In the case of examinations as defined in
sentence 3, tasks shall as far as possible be tailored to test higher-level skills such as
understanding, analysis, transfer and application.
(2) 1Changing the examination form from an (electronic) written examination to an oral
examination may be possible in exceptional circumstances after the semester has
started if the respective degree program and examination regulations allow for both
forms of examinations and the teaching concept of a module has been changed
accordingly at short notice. 2The decision shall be taken by the module coordinator.
3They shall inform students at the latest two weeks after lectures begin if the
examination is to be an oral examination instead of an (electronic) written examination.
4The form of the resit examination in semesters in which the teaching unit is not held
shall follow the form taken by the examination in the semester in which the teaching
unit was last held. 5Resit examinations in semesters in which the teaching unit is held
shall follow the examination form chosen for the semester in question.
(2) The duration of the written examination shall be governed by the relevant degree
program and examination regulations.
(3) 1Written examinations shall be graded by the author of the examination questions
unless stipulated otherwise in the degree program and examination regulations. 2If
a written examination achievement is graded as “nicht ausreichend” (unsatisfactory) it
shall be presented to a second examiner for evaluation. 3The examiner’s evaluation
must be documented in writing and reasons for the final grade must be made clear.
(4) 1Written examinations may take the form of multiple-choice examinations (with one
or more possible correct answers), either in full or in part. 2Detailed information on the
modules with multiple choice examinations is given in the module handbook. 3The
examinee shall state which of the answers to the questions they deem to be correct.
4Examination questions must allow for reliable examination results. 5When drawing up
the examination questions, it shall be specified which of the answers shall be accepted
as correct. 6If the question does not allow multiple answers, multiple answers shall be
inadmissible and disregarded. 7Before the evaluation of the examination results, at
least two of the authors of the examination shall assess whether the examination
questions meet the requirement set out in sentence 4. 8Should they determine that
individual examination questions are faulty, these shall not be taken into account in the
evaluation of the examination result; the number of examination questions shall be
considered to have been reduced. 9This reduction of the number of examination
questions must not result in disadvantages for any of the examinees. 10No minus points
may be awarded outside of individual examination questions.
(5) 1The authors of the examination pursuant to (5)(7) shall determine when the
examinations have been passed pursuant to (5)(1) and shall set a relative pass limit
(sentence 2 (2)). 2Unless stipulated otherwise in the relevant degree program and
examination regulations, examinations pursuant to (4) sentence 1 shall be deemed to
have been passed if
1. the examinee answered at least 50 percent of the examination questions
correctly/achieved at least 50 percent of the attainable points, or
2. the examinee answered at least 40 percent of the examination questions
correctly/achieved at least 40 percent of the attainable points and the number of
12

# Page 13

correct answers/points obtained is no more than 17 percent below the average
number of correct answers/points obtained by all examinees sitting the
examination for the first time.
3The reference group of examinees sitting the examination for the first time pursuant
to sentence 2(2) must consist of at least 50 people, otherwise the relative pass limit
shall not be applicable. 2If sentence 2(2) is applied, the Dean of Studies shall be
notified.
(6) In case of written examinations that are not entirely composed of multiple choice
questions, paragraphs (4) and (5) shall only apply to the respective part.
Section 18 Oral Examination
(1) 1In oral examinations students must demonstrate both general and specific
knowledge of the subject being tested. 2Unless stipulated otherwise, the oral
examinations shall be held as individual examinations. 3Oral examinations taken by
just one authorized examiner shall be conducted in the presence of an observer
appointed by the examiner.
(2) The duration of oral examinations shall be governed by the relevant degree
program and examination regulations.
(3) 1Changing the examination form from an oral examination to an (electronic) written
examination may be possible in exceptional circumstances after the semester has
started if the respective degree program and examination regulations allow for both
forms of examinations and the teaching concept of a module has been changed
accordingly at short notice. 2The decision shall be taken by the module coordinator.
3They shall inform students at the latest two weeks after lectures begin if the
examination is to be an (electronic) written examination instead of an oral examination.
4The form of the resit examination in semesters in which the teaching unit is not held
shall follow the form taken by the examination in the semester in which the teaching
unit was last held. 5Resit examinations in semesters in which the teaching unit is held
shall follow the examination form chosen for the semester in question.
(4) In oral examinations in the presence of several authorized examiners, each
examiner shall determine the grade according to Section 22.
(5) 1A record shall be kept of the oral examination; this shall include the following:
Place, date and duration of the examination; name of the module to which the
examination belongs and number of ECTS credits allocated to the module; subject and
result of the examination; the names of the examiners, the observer and the student;
and any special occurrences. 2The record shall be signed by the authorized examiners
and the observer. 3It shall not be necessary to record the questions asked in the
examination or the answers given. 4The record shall be stored for at least two years.
(6) 1Students planning to undergo the same examination during a subsequent
examination period shall be permitted to be present as listeners during oral
examinations upon request, within the bounds of feasibility with regard to the
examination’s location and at the examiner’s discretion; listeners shall be excluded at
the examinee’s request. 2Students granted permission to attend the oral examination
shall not be permitted to be present during the deliberation process and the
announcement of the examination result.

Section 19 Talks and Presentations
(1) 1In presentations and talks, students should prove that they are capable of working
independently on a scientific topic, presenting it clearly for a particular audience and
defending their point of view in expert discussions. 2Presentations and talks are
assessed on the basis of content, verbal presentation, conduct during the discussion
and, if applicable, performance during the preparation of the presentation. 3The person
who assigns the topic of the presentation should generally be appointed an examiner,
subject to the provisions in Section 10. 4If several authorized examiners pursuant to
Section 10 (1) attend a presentation/talk, there shall be no need to include an observer.
(2) Section 18 (2) and (3) shall apply accordingly.
(3) Presentations may be declared as public in the degree program and examination
regulations or in the module handbook; in this case listeners shall be permitted without
the restriction stipulated in Section 18 (6).
Section 20 Practical Achievements
1The type and scope of the examinations in the practical modules depend on the
specific manner in which the respective module is taught; see module handbook for
details. 2As a rule, the examination consists of conducting various experiments and
documenting the experiments in a series of reports or lab book. 3It is possible for the
documentation of individual experiments to be submitted in advance for an interim
assessment.
Section 21 On-Campus Electronic Examinations
1Examinations may be administered in electronic form on campus. 2Detailed
information on the modules in which examinations are held in electronic form on
campus is given in the module handbook. 3Electronic examinations (e-examinations)
are examinations which are administered and evaluated via computer or using digital
technology. 4The authenticity and integrity of the examination results shall be verified.
5Automatically calculated evaluations of examination achievements shall be verified by
one examiner at the request of the examinee or two examiners in case of a failed
examination.
Section 22 Evaluation of Examinations, Grades, Final Grade
(1) 1The evaluation of individual examinations shall be expressed by the examiners
with the following grades:
Grade (in words) Grade Explanation
sehr gut (very = (1.0 or 1.3) an outstanding achievement
good)
an achievement that exceeds the average
gut (good) = (1.7 or 2.0 or 2.3)
requirements considerably
befriedigend an achievement that fulfills average
= (2.7 or 3.0 or 3.3)
(satisfactory) requirements;
ausreichend an achievement that fulfills the requirements
= (3.7 or 4.0)
(sufficient) despite flaws
nicht ausreichend an achievement that no longer fulfills
= (4.3 or 4.7 or 5.0)
(unsatisfactory) requirements due to considerable flaws.
2An examination (Section 6 (2)) has been passed if it has received at least the grade
“ausreichend” (sufficient). 3For ungraded examinations (Section 6 (3)(4)) the result
shall be either “bestanden” (pass) or “nicht bestanden” (fail). 4Except when otherwise
stipulated in the relevant degree program and examination regulations, a module
14

# Page 15

examination shall have been passed when all parts of the examination or partial
achievements (Section 6 (2)(3)) have been passed. 5If an examination has several
examiners or consists of several parts or partial achievements, the total grade is
calculated from the weighted average of the individual grades; the grading system
described in sentence 1 shall not be used. 2Sentence 5 can also be applied to
examinations that are not an examination consisting of several parts as defined in
Section 6 (2)(3) but still consist of several different components (for example a written
examination with a combination of multiple choice questions and open-ended
questions). Details of how to grade such examinations shall be stipulated in the degree
program and examination regulations. 7One decimal place shall count towards the
module grade; further decimal places shall be omitted without being rounded.
(2) 1The authors of the examination shall set the assessment criteria for multiple choice
examination achievements pursuant to Section 17 (4)(7). 2If no assessment criteria are
set, the examinations shall be graded as follows:3Students who answer the required
minimum of examination questions according to Section 17 (5)(1) correctly shall
receive the grade
- very good (sehr gut) if at least 75 percent of the remaining questions were answered
correctly or remaining points were achieved,
- good (gut) if at least 50 percent but less than 75 percent of the remaining questions
were answered correctly or remaining points were achieved,
- satisfactory (befriedigend) if at least 25 percent but less than 50 percent of the
remaining questions were answered correctly or remaining points were achieved,
- sufficient (ausreichend) if 0 or less than 25 percent of the remaining questions were
answered correctly or remaining points were achieved.
of the remaining examination questions were answered correctly.
4The grade scale set forth at (1)(1) shall apply; the grades 0.7, 4.3 and 4.7 shall not be
awarded. 5Students who do not achieve the required minimum shall receive the grade
5.0. 6Notwithstanding Sentence 4, in addition to the grade 5.0, the grades 4.3 and 4.7
may also be awarded in cases in which examinations according to Section 17 (6) partly
take the form of a multiple choice examination.
(3) The Grundlagen und Orientierungsprüfung (GOP) shall have been passed if the
requirements stipulated in Section 29 of these examination regulations and in the
relevant degree program and examination regulations have been fulfilled.
(4) 1The overall grade of the Bachelor’s examination, the Master’s examination and the
modules shall be as follows:
at an average of up to 1.5 = sehr gut (very good)
at an average of over 1.5 and up to 2.5 = gut (good)
at an average of over 2.5 and up to 3.5 = befriedigend (satisfactory)
at an average of over 3.5 and up to 4.0 = ausreichend (sufficient)
at an average of over 4.0 = nicht ausreichend (unsatisfactory).
2The applicable degree program and examination regulations may stipulate that
students who pass their Bachelor’s or Master’s examination with a total grade better
than 1.2 may receive a degree “with distinction”.
(5) 1Unless stipulated otherwise in the relevant degree program and examination
regulations, the module grades shall be calculated from the average of the individual
grades achieved in the examinations within the meaning of Section 6 (2)(3); the grading
system described in (1) shall not apply. 2Only one decimal place shall count towards
15

# Page 16

the module grade; further decimal places shall be omitted without being rounded. 3If
the Bachelor’s and Master’s thesis modules consist of a thesis and an oral part, the
relevant degree program and examination regulations may stipulate that the
Bachelor’s and Master’s thesis as well as the rest of the module shall be weighted
according to their number of ECTS credits when calculating the module grade. 4If there
is only one graded examination in a module, this grade shall be the grade for the
module. 5If the examination is not graded, the successfully completed module shall
have the result ”bestanden” (pass).
(6) 1Unless otherwise stipulated in the relevant degree program and examination
regulations, all module grades of the Bachelor’s or Master’s degree program shall be
included in the calculation of the final grade of the Bachelor’s or Master’s examination,
weighted according to their ECTS credits. 2 Paragraph 1 sentence 5 (2) and sentence 7
shall apply accordingly.
Section 23 Invalidity of Examinations
(1) If fraudulent methods were used during the examination and if this only becomes
known after the certificate has been awarded, the Examinations Committee
responsible may correct the grade retrospectively and declare the examination as
having been failed in part or in full.
(2) If the requirements for admission to the examination were not fulfilled while no
fraudulent acts were committed willfully, these circumstances shall be considered
remedied by the passing of the examination.
(3) Students shall be given the opportunity to make a statement before a decision is
taken.
(4) 1The incorrect certificates shall be withdrawn; new certificates shall be issued if
applicable. 2A decision according to paragraph (1) shall be excluded after a period of
five years starting with the certificate’s date of issue.
Section 24 Inspection of Examination Records
(1) After the completion of the individual examination procedures, students shall on
request be entitled to inspect their written examination papers, the corresponding
reviews by the examiners, and the examination records.
(2) 1Students shall submit the request to the examination body responsible within one
month of being notified of their grades. 2Unless the Examinations Office is responsible,
the examiner shall allow the inspection; further details shall be decided by the
Examinations Committee. 3Students prevented from observing the deadline according
to (1) through no fault of their own shall be granted full restitution according to Section
32 of the Bavarian Administrative Procedures Act (BayVwVfG).
Section 25 Final Academic Record, Transcript of Records, Diploma
Supplement, Grade Distribution Table and Degree Certificate
(1) 1Students who have successfully completed a degree program pursuant to these
degree program and examination regulations shall receive a final academic record, a
transcript of records, a diploma supplement, a grade distribution table and a degree
certificate, generally within four weeks. 2The certificate shall be signed by the
chairperson of the relevant Examinations Committee.
16

# Page 17

(2) 1The final academic record shall contain the modules and module grades and the
final grade of the Bachelor’s or Master’s examination; it shall also cite the topic of the
Bachelor’s or Master’s thesis. 2The transcript of records lists all modules attended; the
final academic record and the transcript of records may be combined into one
document. 3The transcript of records and the diploma supplement shall be issued in
English and German. 4Information not yet available to the Examinations Office must
be submitted together with the required proof by the time of the degree program’s
completion at the latest; otherwise this information may no longer be taken into
consideration for the documents listed in paragraph (1).
(3) The degree program and examination regulations for the Master’s degree
program GeoThermics/GeoEnergy offered in cooperation with the TUM may stipulate
other provisions.
Section 26 Notification of Failed Examinations
1Students who fail the Bachelor’s or Master’s examination at the final attempt shall
receive notification that the examination has been failed at the final attempt, including
information on legal remedies available. 2Students can also print off an overview of
their grades achieved in the individual modules in the examination administration
system.
Section 27 Adjustments to Examination Arrangements
(1) 1The examination procedure shall be adjusted to take into account the nature and
extent of a student’s disability. 2Students with a doctor’s certificate showing credibly
that they are either partially or fully incapable of sitting the examination in the intended
manner due to long-term or permanent disabilities which do not affect the performance
which is being tested shall be entitled to be granted permission by the chairperson of
the Examinations Committee to have this disadvantage offset by working time being
extended accordingly or the examination process being structured differently.
However, care must be taken to ensure that the examination is still suitable to provide
evidence of skills which are being assessed by the examination. 3Sentences 1 and 2
shall apply accordingly to students in special circumstances, the effects of which on
the student’s ability to sit the examination are similar to a longer illness or disability as
stated above in sentence 2.
(2) Adjustments to examination arrangements may be made for pregnant students, if
the student submits a medical certificate confirming that she will be at least 30 weeks
pregnant by the examination date to the Examinations Committee responsible at the
latest four weeks before the examination date.
(3) 1Decisions pursuant to (1) and (2) shall only be taken by the chairperson of the
Examinations Committee upon written request and after consulting with the Disability
Liaison Officer. 2The student may be required to submit an official certificate from a
medical examiner (vertrauensärztliches Attest) proving the fulfillment of the conditions
in paragraph (1) or other proof confirming the student’s special circumstances.
3Applications for adjustments to examination arrangements should be made to the
Examinations Committee responsible no later than four weeks before the examination.

Part II: Bachelor’s Examination
Section 28 Admission Requirements for Examinations
(1) 1Students enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree program shall be deemed as admitted to
the Bachelor’s examination and the module examinations of which the Bachelor’s
examination consists, unless admission is to be refused. 2Admission shall be refused
if:
1. Requirements are not met or certificates are not submitted at all or not in due time
as stipulated in the special provisions of these examination regulations (Sections
29-31) and in the degree program and examination regulations
2. The applicant has failed the GOP, the Bachelor’s examination, the Diplom
intermediary examination or the Diplom examination, the intermediary examination
or the Magister examination in the same subject or in an equivalent subject
pursuant to the degree program and examination regulations at the final
attempt.
3. It has been ordered that the student is to be de-registered, resulting in the
revocation of the student’s right to sit the examination.
3The cases in sentence 2 also constitute an obstacle to enrollment.
(2) If admission to the examinations is to be refused, the decision shall be taken without
delay, furnished with reasons and information on legal remedies available, and
announced to the student.
Section 29 Grundlagen- und Orientierungsprüfung (GOP)
(1) In the GOP, students should prove that they:
- can fulfill the requirements of an academic course of study in the chosen subjects
– have acquired the methodological skills required to continue their studies
successfully.
(2) 1The GOP shall have been passed when the modules designated as part of the
GOP in the relevant degree program and examination regulations have been
passed and all requirements stipulated in the degree program and examination
regulations have been fulfilled. 2The relevant degree program and examination
regulations shall specify the subject, type and scope of the GOP.
Section 30 Bachelor’s Examination
1The degree program and examination regulations shall specify the subjects, type
and scope of the Bachelor’s examination. 2The Bachelor’s examination shall have been
passed if all subject modules required according to the relevant degree program and
examination regulations have been passed achieving 180 ECTS credits.
Section 31 Bachelor’s Thesis
(1) 1The Bachelor’s thesis is intended to show that the student is capable of dealing
with a problem from the subject area covered by the degree program independently
according to academic methods within a set period and can present the results in an
appropriate form. 2As a rule, the Bachelor's thesis module is worth 10 to 15 ECTS;
further details are stipulated in the relevant degree program and examination
regulations.
18

# Page 19

(2) 1The relevant degree program and examination regulations govern who is
eligible to assign Bachelor’s theses (act as a supervisor). 2The Examinations
Committee responsible shall have the right to grant exceptions. 3The Examinations
Committee responsible may permit students to write their Bachelor’s thesis at an
institution outside the University if supervision there is ensured.
(3) 1Students shall ensure that they are allocated a subject for their Bachelor’s thesis
in time to observe the deadlines set forth in Section 8, usually at the start of the last
semester in the regular duration of studies. 2The Examinations Office shall be notified
of the subject and the date of allocation. 3Should a student not be allocated a subject
despite a genuine effort to that end, the chairperson of the Examinations Committee
responsible shall, in consultation with a representative of the student’s department,
allocate a subject and a supervisor to the student. 4The degree program and
examination regulations may stipulate conditions for allocating a Bachelor’s thesis
deviating from those stipulated in sentence 1.
(4) 1Depending on the degree program and examination regulations, the period
between assigning the topic and submitting the Bachelor’s thesis shall range between
eight and twelve weeks. 2The scope of the subject must be such that it can be
completed within the standard thesis work period. 3The Examinations Committee shall
have the right to extend the period for the thesis by a maximum of four weeks upon
receiving a justified request; the degree program and examination regulations can
stipulate other extension periods. 4If a student submits a doctor’s certificate proving
that they are incapable of working on the thesis due to illness, the period for thesis
work shall be suspended temporarily. 5If the period for working on the thesis is
suspended for a considerable period of time as defined in sentence 4 (3 months
minimum), the Examinations Committee responsible shall check whether the period
for working on the thesis ought to be terminated due to ill health, in which case the
Bachelor's thesis shall be registered with a new topic once the student is well again.
6Sentences 4 and 5 shall apply accordingly in cases in which the student is prevented
from working on the Bachelor's thesis due to serious reasons beyond their control and
outside their sphere of risk.
(5) 1Unless stipulated otherwise in the degree program and examination
regulations, the subject of the Bachelor's thesis cannot be returned. 2If the subject is
returned where it is not admissible, the Bachelor’s thesis shall be graded “nicht
ausreichend” (unsatisfactory; 5.0); it shall be regarded as rejected. 3Sentence 2 shall
apply accordingly if the Bachelor’s thesis is not submitted by the deadline.
(6) 1Unless otherwise stipulated in the degree program and examination
regulations, the thesis shall be written in German, or in English with the permission of
the supervisor. 2If the supervisor agrees, the chairperson of the Examinations
Committee responsible may permit students to write the thesis in a different language
upon request.
(7) 1The Bachelor’s thesis shall generally be evaluated by the supervisor and another
examiner appointed by the chairperson of the Examinations Committee. 2Any
provisions to the contrary shall be stipulated in the degree program and examination
regulations. 3The chairperson of the Examinations Committee responsible shall
arrange for the thesis to be graded within one month as far as possible.
19

# Page 20

(8) 1Unless stipulated otherwise in the relevant degree program and examination
regulations, and depending on the number of evaluations pursuant to (7), one hard
copy (one evaluation) or two hard copies (two evaluations) shall be submitted to the
Examinations Office together with three copies in a machine-readable, electronic
version (pdf document on a CD-ROM). 2The thesis may be left in the letterbox of the
Examinations Office, personally handed in to the Examinations Office during office
hours, or posted to the Examinations Office. 3In the first two cases, the thesis must
have been submitted by the last day of the period allocated for working on the thesis.
If the thesis is sent by post, the date of the postmark is decisive. 4The bound copies
and the electronic copy shall be forwarded to the supervisor, who shall forward one
copy and the electronic copy to the second supervisor. 5The design of the title page
shall follow the template provided by the Examinations Committee responsible. 5The
Bachelor’s thesis shall include a declaration by the student confirming that the thesis
is an original work and that no other sources or materials than the ones listed were
used; Section 14 (2)(2) shall apply.
(9) 1The Bachelor’s thesis shall be accepted if it receives at least the grade
“ausreichend” (sufficient) from all examiners. 2It shall be rejected if it receives the grade
“nicht ausreichend” (unsatisfactory) from all examiners. 3If two evaluations are
submitted and one examiner grades the thesis as “nicht ausreichend” (unsatisfactory)
and the other examiner grades it as at least “ausreichend” (sufficient), a third examiner
shall be appointed. 4If this examiner grades the thesis as “nicht ausreichend”
(unsatisfactory) it shall be rejected; otherwise the thesis shall be given the grade which
is the arithmetic average of the grades of all three evaluations; Section 22 (1)
sentences 5 and 7 shall apply.
(10) 1If the Bachelor’s thesis has been accepted according to (9)(1) and if examiners
give the thesis a different grade in those cases where two evaluations are required,
the final grade of the Bachelor’s thesis shall be the arithmetic average of the grades
from the two examiners; the grading system pursuant to Section 22 (1)(1) shall not
apply and only one decimal place shall be shown in the final thesis grade. 2If there is
a discrepancy of two or more entire grades between the evaluations of the two
examiners (= “very good”, “good”...), (9) sentences 3 and 4 shall apply accordingly.
(11) 1If a Bachelor’s thesis is rejected, it may be repeated only once; a second
repetition or revision shall not be permitted. 2The student shall ensure that they receive
a new subject for the repetition of the Bachelor’s thesis within two months following the
announcement of the rejection; otherwise the Bachelor’s thesis shall be regarded as
having been failed at the final attempt; paragraph 3 (3) and (4) shall apply accordingly.
3 Paragraphs 1 and 2, paragraph 3 sentences 3 and 4 and paragraphs 4 to 10 shall
apply accordingly in the case of a repetition.
Section 32 Resit Examinations
(1) 1With the exception of the GOP and the Bachelor’s thesis module, every failed
module examination or partial examination may be resat twice. 2The resit examination
shall be limited to the failed examination or course achievement. 3Section 31 (11) shall
apply to the repetition of the Bachelor’s thesis module. 4The resit examination must be
sat on the next possible date, which shall generally be in the semester following the
first examination. 5The student shall be considered as registered for the next resit
examination. 6Students shall be obliged to check the status of their registration in the
examination administration system regularly and inform the Examinations Office
20

# Page 21

immediately of any discrepancies. 7The resit period shall not be interrupted by de-
registration or leave of absence. 8If a student misses the resit examination or the resit
period is not observed, the examination shall be deemed to have been failed unless
the Examinations Committee responsible grants the student a respite due to special
reasons beyond the student’s control. The standard deadlines according to Section 8
(1) shall continue to apply. 9The provisions regarding maternity protection, parental

Section 33 Key Qualifications
(1) Students in Bachelor’s and Master’s degree programs must successfully complete
modules worth a maximum of 20 ECTS credits in the key qualifications area.
(2) The degree program and examination regulations may limit the selection in the core

stipulated in Section 8 in addition to successfully completed modules. 2If a student
completes additional modules of the degree program at FAU, the student shall decide
which of the modules shall go into the calculation of the final grade. 3Students shall
notify the Examinations Office of their decision at the latest eight weeks before the
degree certificate is issued. 4This decision is binding. 5If no choice is made and if there
are different modules from which to choose, the Examinations Office shall use the
module with the better grade for the calculation.
(2) 1Modules from other degree programs offered as partial qualifications for this
degree program are also classed as additional modules. 2Examination procedures for
such modules are governed by the regulations stipulated in the degree program and
examination regulations for the degree program containing the additional module.
3Additional modules pursuant to (2) are not included in the final grade, but are shown
in a separate section of the transcript of records. 4If the student files a request with the
Examinations Office at the latest eight weeks before certificates are issued, individual
additional modules may be omitted from the final certificate.

21

# Page 22

2The relevant degree program and examination regulations for the Master’s degree
program stipulate which qualifications are considered subject-specific, subject-related
or equivalent pursuant to sentence 1 item 1.
(2) 1Degrees according to (1)(1)(1) and (1)(2) must be equivalent to the subject-specific
Bachelor’s examination according to these examination regulations and the relevant
degree program and examination regulations with regard to the knowledge gained.
2If there are significant differences which can be compensated for, the Admissions
Committee may grant admission under the condition that proof of further achievements
worth up to a maximum of 20 ECTS credits and to be determined by the Admissions
Committee be submitted within one year of taking up studies for a Master’s degree
program. 3Admission in this case shall be granted conditionally.
(3) 1Notwithstanding (1)(1)(1), students who are enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree
program may be admitted to a Master’s degree program if they have achieved a
minimum number of ECTS credits according to the provisions stipulated in the relevant
degree program and examination regulations; the minimum number of ECTS credits
shall be no less than 135. 2Proof of the successfully completed Bachelor’s degree must
be submitted at the latest within one year of taking up the Master’s degree program;
completing the Bachelor’s degree program is a prerequisite for formally starting the
Master’s degree program. 3Admission to the Master’s degree program shall be granted
conditionally.
Section 36 Admission to Examinations
1Students enrolled in the Master’s degree program shall be considered admitted to the
Master’s examination and the module examinations of which the Master’s examination
consists, unless admission is to be refused. 2Admission shall be refused if:
1. Requirements are not met or certificates are not submitted at all or not in due time
as stipulated in the special provisions of these examination regulations (Sections
37-39) and in the degree program and examination regulations
2. The student has failed the Diplom, Magister or Master’s examination in a degree
program classed according to the degree program and examination regulations
as being in the same or a comparable subject at the final attempt
3. It has been ordered that the student is to be de-registered, resulting in the
revocation of the student’s right to sit the examination.
3The cases in sentence 2 also constitute an obstacle to enrollment. 4Section 28 (2)
shall apply accordingly.
Section 37 Master’s Examination
(1) 1The Master’s examination shall consist of all module examinations throughout the
degree program including the Master’s thesis module. 2The relevant degree program
and examination regulations may stipulate that the Master’s thesis is to be
complemented by a final oral examination in the same module (Master’s colloquium).
3To complete the Master’s degree, students must pass all required module
examinations including the Master’s thesis module and oral examination, if applicable.
4Modules which have already been the subject of a Bachelor’s examination cannot
usually be accredited as part of the Master’s examination due to the specific subject
skills that must be gained as part of the qualification goals of the consecutive Master’s
degree program; the Examinations Committee responsible can allow exceptions.
22

# Page 23

(2) The relevant degree program and examination regulations shall specify the
subjects, type and scope of the Master’s examination.
Section 38 Master’s Thesis
(1) 1The Master’s thesis is a graded written assignment that concludes the Master’s
degree. 2It is intended to show that the student is capable of dealing with a problem
from their field independently and according to scientific methods within a set period.
3In order to avoid plagiarism, the Master’s thesis may not to any significant degree be
identical to a previously submitted Diplom, Bachelor’s or Master’s thesis or dissertation
or an extended written assignment (Zulassungsarbeit) in a teaching degree program
(Lehramt); Section 15 shall remain unaffected. 4According to the provisions set forth in
the relevant degree program and examination regulations, 25 or 30 ECTS credits
are awarded for the Master’s thesis module.
(2) 1Students shall ensure that they are allocated a subject for their Master’s thesis in
time to observe the deadlines set forth in Section 8, usually at the start of the last
semester in the regular duration of studies. 2The subject and the date of its allocation
shall be confirmed by the supervisor and presented to the Examinations Office. 3Should
a student not be allocated a subject, despite a genuine effort to that end, the
chairperson of the Examinations Committee shall, in consultation with a representative
of the student’s department, allocate a subject and a supervisor to the student. 4The
degree program and examination regulations may stipulate conditions for allocating
a Master’s thesis deviating from sentence 1.
(3) 1The relevant degree program and examination regulations govern who is
eligible to assign Master’s theses (act as a supervisor). 2Section 31 (2) sentences 2
and 3 and (7) shall apply accordingly.
(4) 1The time between the selection of a subject and the submission of the Master’s
thesis shall be six months; the scope of the subject must be such that it can be dealt
with within this period. 2If the degree program and examination regulations do not
stipulate otherwise, the Examinations Committee responsible can extend the period
for working on the thesis up to twice by six weeks at a time. 3If a student submits a
doctor’s certificate proving that they are incapable of working on the Master’s thesis,
the period for thesis work shall be suspended temporarily. 4If the period for working on
the thesis is suspended for a considerable period of time as defined in sentence 4 (6
months minimum), the Examinations Committee responsible shall check whether the
period for working on the thesis ought to be terminated due to ill health, in which case
the Master's thesis shall be registered with a new topic once the student is well again.
5Sentences 3 and 4 shall apply accordingly in cases in which the student is prevented
from working on the Master’s thesis due to serious reasons beyond their control and
outside their sphere of risk.
(5) 1The subject may only be returned once with good reason and with the approval of
the chairperson of the Examinations Committee within the first third of the period for
thesis work. 2Otherwise the Master’s thesis shall be graded “nicht ausreichend”
(unsatisfactory; 5.0) if the subject is returned; it shall be regarded as rejected.
(6) 1The relevant degree program and examination regulations govern the language in
which the Master’s thesis is to be written. 2The Master’s thesis shall contain a summary
of results at the end. 3The design of the title page shall follow the template provided by
23

# Page 24

the Examinations Committee responsible. 4The Master’s thesis shall include a
declaration by the student confirming that the thesis is an original work and that no
other sources or materials than the ones listed were used; Section 14 (2)(2) shall apply.
5Unless stipulated otherwise in the relevant degree program and examination
regulations, two hard copies of the Master’s thesis and two machine-readable,
electronic copies (PDF document on CD-ROM or another storage device approved by
the Examinations Office) shall be submitted to the Examinations Office; the date of
submission shall be recorded in writing. 6The thesis may be left in the letterbox of the
Examinations Office, personally handed in to the Examinations Office during office
hours, or posted to the Examinations Office. 7In the first two cases, the thesis must
have been submitted by the last day of the period allocated for working on the thesis.
If the thesis is sent by post, the date of the postmark is decisive. 8If the Master’s thesis
is not submitted in time, it shall be graded “nicht ausreichend” (unsatisfactory; 5.0); it
shall be regarded as rejected.
(7) Section 31 (7) and (9) shall apply accordingly.
(8) 1If the Master’s thesis has been accepted according to (7) in conjunction with
Section 31 (9) (1) and if in the case of evaluation by two examiners the evaluations of
the two examiners are no more than two grade levels apart, the grade of the Master’s
thesis shall be the arithmetic average of the grades from the two examiners; the
grading system pursuant to Section 22 (1)(1) shall not apply and only one decimal
place shall be shown in the final thesis grade. 2If the evaluations from the two
examiners differ by more than two grade levels, the chairperson of the Examinations
Committee responsible shall appoint a third examiner. 3The average of the three
grades shall be calculated. The grade scale set forth in Section 22 (1)(1) shall not apply
and only one decimal place shall be shown in the final thesis grade.
(9) 1If the Master’s thesis is rejected or if it is regarded as rejected, it may be repeated
once; a second repetition shall not be permitted. 2The student shall ensure that they
receive a new subject for the repetition of the Master’s thesis within the semester
following the announcement of the rejection at the latest. 3Otherwise the Master’s
thesis shall be regarded as having been failed at the final attempt; (2)(3) shall apply
accordingly. 4Paragraphs 1 and 2 sentences 2 to 4 and paragraphs 3 to 8 shall apply
accordingly for the repetition of the Master’s thesis; returning the subject shall not be
permitted. 5The chairperson of the Examinations Committee may permit the student to
submit a revised version of the Master’s thesis within two months of the announcement
of its rejection provided the student agrees and this has not been ruled out after the
review. Revision shall not be permitted if the Master’s thesis was rejected on grounds
of fraud or plagiarism. 6Sentence 4 shall apply accordingly if a student is permitted to
submit a revised version of the thesis.
Section 39 Resitting Examinations, Additional Modules
Unless stipulated otherwise in the degree program and examination regulations
Sections 32 and 34 shall apply accordingly to resitting examinations and taking
additional modules.
