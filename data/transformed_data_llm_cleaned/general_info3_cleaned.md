The average grade shall be calculated by weighting the grades of the achievements according to the weighting of the ECTS credits in the individual modules; achievements in modules with more credits shall therefore have more weighting than modules with fewer credits. Notwithstanding (5)(4) of the Appendix to ABMPOMathe/NatFak, only those applicants shall be invited to the oral admission examination whose average grade in modules related to mathematics and computer science in their undergraduate degree that is subject-specific, subject-related or relevant to the specific Master’s degree program or another equivalent German or non-German qualification with equivalent content pursuant to Section 31 (1)(1)(1), Section 31 sentence 2 or Section 31 (3) is worse than 2.5 (good), but at least 2.8 (satisfactory).  
(4) In the oral admission examination according to Section 5 (4) et seq. of the Appendix to ABMPOMathe/NatFak, applicants shall be evaluated according to the following criteria:  
1. Quality of knowledge in the foundations of the subject (analysis, linear algebra, algorithms and data structures) (35%)  
2. Quality of basic knowledge in two specialist areas within the specializations suggested by the applicant pursuant to Section 45 (3) (35%)  
3. Ability to hold an academic discussion in English on topics relating to mathematics and computer science (30%).  
(5) Notwithstanding (5) sentences 9 and 12 in the Appendix to ABMPOMathe/NatFak, the admissions interview is conducted by two individuals with doctoral degrees whose main employment is at the Department of Mathematics, Data Science or Computer Science appointed by the admissions committee. After the interview, they shall submit a recommendation to the admissions committee stating whether the applicant should be offered a place on the degree program or not. The admissions committee decides on the basis of this recommendation whether to accept or reject the applicant.
